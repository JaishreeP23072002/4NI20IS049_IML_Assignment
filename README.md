## Program : Non-Parametric Locally Weighted Depletion Algorithm
## Information : The Non-Parametric Locally Weighted Depletion Algorithm (NPLWD) is a machine learning algorithm used for regression and classification tasks. It estimates the relationship between input and output variables based on locally weighted observations. It assigns weights to observations based on their proximity to a query point, fits a local model using the weighted observations, and estimates the output value for the query point. NPLWD is effective for modeling non-linear relationships and capturing local variations in the data. However, it may be computationally inefficient for large datasets.
